# itanks-2.0
This is a rewrite of the iTanks code.

# Requirements

* Monkey X: [http://www.monkey-x.com/](http://www.monkey-x.com/)
* FantomEngine: [http://www.fantomgl.com/](http://www.fantomgl.com/)
* Diddy Framework: [https://code.google.com/p/diddy/](https://code.google.com/p/diddy/)

# Current State

Refactoring in progress and currently doesn't compile.  There are quite a few problems in the code that I'm working through.  Hopefully I'm able to make something that compiles and runs shortly
